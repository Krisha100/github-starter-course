# :wave: The Basics of Git and GitHub

## ü§ì Course overview and learning outcomes 

The goal of this course is to provide a crash course to Git and GitHub, intended for people with little to no experience with either.

### Objectives

- develop a clear mental model of what Git is, how it works behind the scenes, and how it ties into GitHub
- become comfortable with the GitHub web interface. GitHub is an excellent place (but not the only one!) to manage and interact with Git repositories online.

We‚Äôll also provide links to additional resources for you to continue your journey with Git and GitHub. üöÄ

## :octocat: Git and GitHub

Git is a **distributed Version Control System (VCS)**.

A **version control system** is a software tool that helps you track changes to a pile o' files - these can be any kinds of files, images, plain text source code files, even binaries. Every time changes are made to a file, you can tell the version control system, "hey, keep track of the changes I just made to this file". In typical usage, we will be keeping track of plain text, source code files. It's not recommended to put "generated" artifacts into Git (like a compiled executable that only runs on Linux, or a Windows .exe file or a macOS application bundle) because these are *derivatives* and often change. Instead, you want to put the *source material* into Git, the things that are used to create the derivative.

### Why do we need version control systems?

If you've ever had to collaborate with others on writing a paper or on a team coding project, you have probably experienced something like this:

or this:

Git helps you bypass these messy filename-based versioning systems and helps you keep track of changes to your code and collaborate and share your changes with others in a disciplined, systematic way. You can keep a record of what you‚Äôve worked on alongside plaintext notes (these are called *commit log messages* and we will go into more detail about them later). It also allows you to easily revert back to older versions as needed giving you the freedom to experiment in your code without having to worry about whether you can undo all the changes or find the base working version you wanted to keep. It also comes with a lot of tools that make working with others easier ‚Äî groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source that preserves transparency and the provenance of which changes came from where.

GitHub is a way to use the same power of Git online with an easy-to-use web interface. It‚Äôs widely used in the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.

GitHub is home to some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics of GitHub, but we'll dig into the rest later.

## Git Started

Let's start with some common terms and definitions.

### Repositories

A repository is where your project work happens -- think of it as your root project folder that contains all your project‚Äôs files (and revision history, in the git managed `.git` directory).  
You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files. Repositories are just
that pile of files with the special `.git` directory accompanying them and can reside locally on your laptop or desktop
computer, or on a server in the cloud like GitHub.

### Cloning 

When a repository is created on GitHub.com (i.e., you click on the "New" button from your GitHub dashboard or the "Repositories" tab in your GitHub profile), it‚Äôs stored remotely in the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è. You can clone this repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to keep the two repositories synced up. 

This makes it easier to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. You can also use the editing tool of your choice as opposed to the GitHub UI. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project! This can be helpful if you experiment with your project and then realize you liked a previous version more. 

To learn more about cloning, read ["Cloning a Repository"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). 

### Committing and pushing
**Committing** and **pushing** are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. That way your instructor and/or teammates can see your latest work when you‚Äôre ready to share it. You can make a commit when you have made changes to your project that you want to ‚Äúcheckpoint.‚Äù You can also add a helpful **commit message** to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did (e.g. ‚ÄúAdded a README with information about our project‚Äù).

Once you have a commit or multiple commits that you‚Äôre ready to add to your repository, you can use the push command to add those changes to your remote repository. Committing and pushing may feel new at first, like all things it'll become like second nature once you build Git into your development workflow üôÇ

## üíª GitHub terms to know 

### Repositories 
We mentioned repositories already, they are where your project work happens, but let‚Äôs talk a bit more about the details of them! As you work more on GitHub you will have many repositories which may feel confusing at first. Fortunately, your ["GitHub dashboard"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/about-your-personal-dashboard) helps to easily navigate to your repositories and see useful information about them. Make sure you‚Äôre logged in to see it!

Repositories also contain **README**s. You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it. We are using this README to communicate how to learn Git and GitHub with you. üòÑ 
To learn more about repositories read ["Creating, Cloning, and Archiving Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories) and ["About README's"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes). 

### Branches
You can use branches on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository‚Äîmain. This makes a new working copy of your repository for you to experiment with. Once your new changes have been reviewed by a teammate, or you are satisfied with them, you can merge your changes into the default branch of your repository.
To learn more about branching, read ["About Branches"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches).

### Forks
A fork is another way to copy a repository, but is usually used when you want to contribute to someone else‚Äôs project. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contributing to open source software projects!
To learn more about forking, read ["Fork a repo"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)

### Pull requests
When working with branches, you can use a pull request to tell others about the changes you want to make and ask for their feedback. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add more changes if need be. You can add specific people as reviewers of your pull request which shows you want their feedback on your changes! Once a pull request is ready-to-go, it can be merged into your main branch.
To learn more about pull requests, read ["About Pull Requests"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). 


### Issues
Issues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub. Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on. You can also use issues to tell a favorite open source project about a bug you found or a feature you think would be great to add!

For larger projects, you can keep track of many issues on a project board. GitHub Projects help you organize and prioritize your work and you can read more about them [in this "About Project boards document](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards). You likely won‚Äôt need a project board for your assignments, but once you move on to even bigger projects, they‚Äôre a great way to organize your team‚Äôs work!
You can also link together pull requests and issues to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request.
To learn more about issues and linking them to your pull requests, read ["About Issues"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues). 

### Your user profile

Your profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you're interested in, the contributions you've made, and the conversations you've had. You can also give the world a unique view into who you are with your profile README. You can use your profile to let future employers know all about you! 
To learn more about your user profile and adding and updating your profile README, read ["Managing Your Profile README"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme). 

### Using markdown on GitHub 

You might have noticed already, but you can add some fun styling to your issues, pull requests, and files. ["Markdown"](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is an easy way to style your issues, pull requests, and files with some simple syntax. This can be helpful to organize your information and make it easier for others to read. You can also drop in gifs and images to help convey your point!
To learn more about using GitHub‚Äôs flavor of markdown, read ["Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). 


### Beginners Git Workflow

Now that we have some basic terminology for Git and GitHub under our belt we can start to go into typical workflows for
how we can use Git to manage changes to our files. 

The simplest Git workflow is to have a single committer, you, commit and push all of your changes to your local
repository and synchronize that with GitHub. 

0. Have a Git repository cloned on your local computer e.g., `C:\Users\my-username\GitHub\my-first-fisher-price-git-repository`
1. Make some changes to your files in your git repository
2. (Alternatively, you can also make changes to your files directly in the GitHub web interface)
3. Commit your changes selectively and include meaningful log messages
4. Push them to your hosted repository on GitHub.com

## Advanced

The GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment and collaborate on your projects easily, without the risk of losing your previous work. It uses Pull Requests and branches to manage incoming changes and is better suited to larger scale collaborative development where you have many people working in tandem on code.

https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow

## General Git Guidelines

1. **Keep commits small and isolated** if you can. Think of commits as logical, self-contained checkpoints of your code, 
   e.g., 
        - add a new feature
        - fix a bug
        - improve a visualization
        - improve text labels or documentation
        - fix a typo or other speling error 
2. **Commit early, commit often** and frequently synchronize your work to make sure your local version of the Git
   repository doesn't become stale and out-of-date. This is less of a problem when you are the only one working on
   things, but is still a good habit to keep.
3. **Write meaningful log messages** that clearly document the intent of your change(s). Think of commit log messages as notes to your
   future self and/or your future collaborators.
4. **Use tags and releases** to keep track of important coding milestones. The exact version of your computational model 
   that generated data leading to publishable findings? That should be a new tag and release with a [DOI
   attached to that release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content).
